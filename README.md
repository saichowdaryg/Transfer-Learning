# Transfer-Learning

This notebook has all the code required to download images from imagenet database and use VGG16, RESNet and Inception Networks
to classify them after using Transfer Learning technique(in Keras) to classify them. This notebook will get you started with Transfer Learning in Neural Networks. Have Fun!
